1   Come unto these yellow sands,
2   And then take hands:
3   Court'sied when you have, and kiss'd,
4   The wild waves whist
5   Foot it featly here and there;
6   
7   And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
8   
9   Hark, hark!
10  Bow, wow,
11  
12  The watch-dogs bark:
13  
14  Bow, wow.
15  
16  Hark, hark! I hear
17  The strain of strutting chanticleer
18  Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow!
