1   Come unto these yellow sands,
2   And then take hands:
3   Court'sied when you have, and kiss'd,
4   The wild waves whist
5   Foot it featly here and there;

6   And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.

7   Hark, hark!
8   Bow, wow,

9   The watch-dogs bark:

10  Bow, wow.

11  Hark, hark! I hear
12  The strain of strutting chanticleer
13  Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow!
